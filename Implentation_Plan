Full Disclosure: I haven't worked extensively with any autograding functionality or servers yet in my career (in higher-ed)
but I am willing to take sometime to learn more (Already doing so) about how they work and how we can implement them
correctly in this instance however below are details of how I would implement all tests needed to our CI system with
my current knowledge of CI/CD and DevOps in general.

The repos where students would submit their code will have .gitlab-ci.yml files and pre-written Dockerfiles
all in place, if you look at my .gitlab-ci.yml file, you will see that I added sections for three tests,
these would cover the three test cases stated in the exercise document.


The closed test could be a python test suite implemented with the unittest module with assertions to match or cover
expected results of what the students code should do.

For the student test, I added a sample testcase to make sure my id function returns the expected output.


When a student pushes code (an example code is the identityfunc.py python file included : which is just a python
function that returns a tuple containing arguments passed into the function) to the repo, with our pipeline already
setup, the docker image will be built and all tests cases and our autograding functionality declared as stages will kick
in, thereafter if there is any deployment that needs to occur, the deploy stage will take care of that. I have added
comments to the ci yml file to further explain what some configurations mean/do as well as an optional sast stage: see
(https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/merge_requests/sast.html) for more about SAST.



Afterthoughts:
I should also say that docker image builds successfully as it is but we can improve on it's size by using a
smaller base image tailored to a specific project, in this case however, I used an Ubuntu base image for the purpose of
generalization. For specific images: alter the docker file to your choice of a specific official image from docker hub
- https://hub.docker.com/

I should also say that I spent sometime ready this paper
https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~droh/papers/autolab-ieee-ic.pdf which highlights some feature of how CMU implemented
autograding but this has little to do with CI/CD pipelines.
